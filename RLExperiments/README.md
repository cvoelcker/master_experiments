# Object Segementation for Reinforcement Learning

My master thesis, written under the supervision of Karl Stelzner, Alejandro Molina, and Kristian Kersting @ TU Darmstadt 2019

The focus of the work is on exploring object segementation methods as feature generation for different reinforcement learning algorithms. We are investgating sample complexity, transferability and how different algorithms act under additional information.
